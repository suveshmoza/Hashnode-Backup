As a tech-savvy job seeker, your resume is more than just a document‚Äîit's your gateway to the tech industry. This blog will explore a step-by-step guide on crafting an ATS-friendly resume that ensures your candidacy reaches human eyes.

### Step 1. Choosing a good Resume Template

Choosing an ATS-friendly resume template is important because if the ATS is not able to read the information from your resume, it will flag it and you will get rejected. Also, avoid using two-column templates as they can confuse the parsing algorithms, as they may struggle to determine which column contains which type of information. The most commonly used ATS templates I have seen are:

1. [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs)
    
2. [Modern Deedy](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/modern-deedy/cxtjgrmpsrvh)
    
3. [FAANGPATH Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/faangpath-simple-template/npsfpdqnxmbc)
    

### Step 2. Adding Contact Information

Include your name, phone number, email, GitHub and LinkedIn profile links. Make sure your contact information is up to date, as it helps the recruiter to contact you directly.

### Step 3. Add Education Information

Mention your degree, university, graduation date and GPA (if it's strong).

### Step 4. Professional Experience

Detail your work experience, including internships, part-time, freelance and full-time roles. Use bullet points to describe your achievements and accomplishments. Quantifying your achievements and accomplishments is important. For this, you can use the **XYZ Rule**

**<mark>"Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]"</mark>**

Example: Developed a responsive web application that increased user engagement by 20%.

### Step 5. Projects:

Highlight your projects and open-source contributions. Describe the problem you have solved or what your project does. Describe the technologies and tools you have used while building your project.

**<mark>Add deployed links and GitHub links of your projects</mark>**

### **Step 6. Highlight Skills and Achievements**

Have a section where you can highlight all the programming languages, frameworks, databases and tools you are proficient in. For achievements, also have a separate section and write about your top 5 achievements using bullet points like good rank in a coding competition or winning a hackathon.

### **Step 7. Proofread and Edit**:

Ensure there are no typos or grammatical errors and make sure that the resume is concise and easy to read. The aim should be **one page.**

**TIPS:**

1. Don't use the same resume for all roles. Have different versions of your resume for different roles. Don't send a Frontend-related resume for a Backend role.
    
2. Try to apply with a cover letter if there is an option for it while applying else you can write a referral message to a person working in the company you are applying.
