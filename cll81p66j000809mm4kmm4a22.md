If you are preparing for JavaScript Interview, Frontend Interview or Backend Interview where most of the stuff is done using JavaScript, then there is a high possibility that you will be asked to implement your version(called Polyfill) of an inbuilt JS function like map, filter, etc.

### What exactly is Polyfill and why is it asked?

A polyfill is a piece of computer code written to implement a feature in a browser that does not yet support it. It could be because of the older version of the browser you are using, or because the new version of the browser does not have that feature.

Coming to why is it asked, creating a polyfill demonstrates that you have a strong understanding of JavaScript's core concepts, including functions, prototypes, closures, and other language features. It also shows your ability to work with the language at an advanced level.

### <mark>map function</mark>

The `map` function is used to transform each element of an array by applying a provided callback function. It creates a new array containing the results of applying the callback to each element of the original array.

```javascript
// Syntax of map function
// Array.map((currVal, index, arr)=>{})
const arr=[1,2,3,4,5];
const sqArr=arr.map((item)=>item*item);
const multByIndex=arr.map((item,index)=>item*index);
```

In the above example, we can see that the map function takes a `callbackFn`. The function is executed for each element in the array. Its return value is added as a single element in the new array. The function is called with the following arguments:

1. **currVal**: The current element being processed in the array.
    
2. **index**: The index of the current element being processed in the array.
    
3. arr: The array `map` was called upon.
    
4. thisArg \[Optional\]: A value to use as `this` when executing `callbackFn.`
    

Now let's write the polyfill for the map:

```javascript
const arr=[1,2,3,4,5];

Array.prototype.myMap=function(cb){
  let temp=[];
  for(let i=0;i<this.length;i++){
  	temp.push(cb(this[i],i,this)); 
  }
  return temp;
}

const newArr=arr.myMap((item,index)=>item*index);
const sqArr=arr.myMap((item)=>item*item);
console.log(newArr);
console.log(sqArr);
```

Code Breakdown:

1. An array `arr` is created with values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
    
2. The `myMap` method is added to the `Array` prototype. This method takes a callback function `cb` as its argument.
    
3. Inside the `myMap` method:
    
    * A temporary array `temp` is created to store the transformed values.
        
    * A loop goes through each element of the array.
        
    * The callback function `cb` is applied to each element, along with its index and the original array. The result is added to the `temp` array.
        
    * The `temp` array is returned.
        
4. The results are logged into the console.
    

### <mark>filter function</mark>

The `filter` function is used to create a new array containing only the elements that pass a certain condition specified by the provided callback function.

```javascript
// Syntax of filter function
// array.filter((currentValue, index, arr)=>{});
const words = ['Hello', 'World', '!', 'How', 'Are', 'You'];
const result = words.filter((word) => word.length > 6);
console.log(result);
```

In the above example, we can see that the filter function takes a `callbackFn`. This function is executed for each element in the array. It should return a truthy value to keep the element in the resulting array, and a falsy value otherwise. The function is called with the following arguments:

1. **currVal**: The current element being processed in the array.
    
2. **index**: The index of the current element being processed in the array.
    
3. arr: The array `filter` was called upon.
    
4. thisArg \[Optional\]: A value to use as `this` when executing `callbackFn.`
    

Now let's write the polyfill for the filter function:

```javascript
const words = ['Hello', 'World', '!', 'How', 'Are', 'You'];

Array.prototype.myFilter=function(cb){
  let temp=[];
  for(let i=0;i<this.length;i++){
   if(cb(this[i],i,this)){
     temp.push(this[i]);
   } 
  }
  return temp;
}

const result = words.myFilter((word) => word!=="!");
console.log(result);
```

Code Breakdown:

1. An array of `words` is defined by several words.
    
2. The `myFilter` method is added to the `Array` prototype. This method takes a callback function `cb` as its argument.
    
3. Inside the `myFilter` method:
    
    * A temporary array `temp` is created to store the filtered values.
        
    * A loop iterates over each element of the array.
        
    * The callback function `cb` is applied to each element, and if the result is `true`, the element is added to the `temp` array.
        
    * The `temp` array containing filtered values is returned.
        
4. The `myFilter` method is used with a callback that checks if a word is not equal to `"!"`.
    
5. The filtered result is logged into the console.
    

### <mark>reduce function</mark>

The `reduce` function is used to "reduce" an array to a single value by applying a callback function to each element, accumulating a result along the way.

```javascript
// Syntax of reduce function
// array.reduce((total, currValue, currIndex, arr)=>{}, initialValue)
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  return accumulator + currentValue;
}, 0);
console.log(sum);
```

In the above example, we can see that the reduce function takes a `callbackFn`. This function is executed for each element in the array. Its return value becomes the value of the `accumulator` parameter on the next invocation of `callbackFn`. For the last invocation, the return value becomes the return value of `reduce()`. The function is called with the following arguments:

1. **currValue**: The value of the current element. On the first call, the value of `array[0]` if an `initialValue` was specified, otherwise the value of `array[1]`.
    
2. **accumulator**: The value resulting from the previous call to `callbackFn`. On the first call, `initialValue` if specified, otherwise the value of `array[0]`.
    
3. **index:** The index position of `currentValue` in the array. On the first call, `0` if `initialValue` was specified, otherwise `1`.
    
4. arr: The array `reduce` was called upon.
    
5. initialValue \[Optional\]: A value to which `accumulator` is initialized the first time the callback is called. If `initialValue` is specified, `callbackFn` starts executing with the first value in the array as `currentValue`. If `initialValue` is *not* specified, `accumulator` is initialized to the first value in the array, and `callbackFn` starts executing with the second value in the array as `currentValue`.
    

Now let's write the polyfill for the reduce function:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

Array.prototype.myReduce=function(cb,initialValue){
    let accumulator=initialValue;
    for(let i=0;i<this.length;i++){
        accumulator=accumulator?cb(accumulator,this[i],i,this):this[i];
    }
    return accumulator;
}
const sum = numbers.myReduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  return accumulator + currentValue;
}, 0);
console.log(sum);
```

Code Breakdown:

1. An array `numbers` are defined: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
    
2. A custom `myReduce` function is added to the `Array` prototype:
    
    * It takes two arguments: `cb` (callback function) and `initialValue`.
        
    * An `accumulator` is initialized with the value of `initialValue`.
        
    * A loop iterates over the array elements.
        
    * For each element, the `cb` function is called with arguments `accumulator`, `this[i]` (current element), `i` (index), and `this` (original array). The result is assigned to the `accumulator`.
        
    * The `accumulator` is returned after the loop.
        
3. Using `myReduce` to calculate the sum:
    
    * The `myReduce` function is used on the `numbers` array.
        
    * The callback function `(accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue` adds the current value to the accumulator.
        
    * An initial value of `0` is provided for the accumulator.
        
4. The `sum` is logged to the console.
    

We have written polyfill for map, filter, and reduce. üëè

In the upcoming blog, we will be learning about Promises and difference between all of its methods.
